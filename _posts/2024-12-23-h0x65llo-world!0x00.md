Hello everyone, my name is Jafar Mohammed Untar (b4ng), this is my personal blog, I am a Red Team Operator and Security Researcher, currently working at [Unidade 37](https://www.unidade37.com.br).

I am in my journey to learn pwning and exploit development / binary/kernel exploitation, and I will put here write-ups and notes about CTFs and study content.

I am specialized in penetration testing and red team operations, working professionally in the field for more than 2 years. Since the beginning I was really interested in pwning but never had the guts to start, until now.
